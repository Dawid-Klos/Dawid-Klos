## 🚀 About Me

Hey there! I'm a full-stack developer passionate about building modern applications and exploring new technologies. My journey is a classic tale of rediscovery, growth, and finding my true calling in code.

## 🛤️ My Journey 
My passion with computers began in my teenage years, but like many great stories, there was a plot twist. In early 2020, I stumbled upon "WTF: What that Fronted?" (yes, that's the actual name!), which completely reignited my programming spark. Those fundamental building blocks — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — became my gateway back into the world of development.

That same year, I enrolled at the University of Chester for a BSc in Computer Science, where I dove deep into backend development, system design, and databases. This solid foundation led me to an internship in the insurance pricing industry, crafting custom pricing models with Python and React.

After 7 months, the entrepreneurial itch got the better of me—I took the leap into freelancing! The universe seemed to align, and over 5 months, I built 3 websites for companies across Germany, Poland, and the UK. Talk about a European coding tour! 🌍

Since 2024, I've been working as a full-stack developer in the medical industry with Java Spring Boot, React, and React Native, combining my love for both web and mobile technologies.

## 🔍 Current Adventures 
When I'm not debugging someone else's code, you'll find me exploring Golang — I'm absolutely smitten with its elegant simplicity. I'm putting it through its paces with my passion project: Strength Forge, a modern workout log app I've been crafting since October 2024, featuring a sleek React Native frontend powered by an amazing Golang backend.
